# About me

I'm a:
- 🖥 Hardware enthusiast (I collect a lot of tech-related things like old computers, speakers, mobile phones etc.)
- 👨‍💻 Rookie programmer (I only know HTML, C++ and JS as of now)
- 😺 Fursuitless furry (I don't have the budget to get or make one, nor do I plan on having one anytime soon)
